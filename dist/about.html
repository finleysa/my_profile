        <p>
          <b>US Naval Aircrew veteran:</b> I joined the Navy in 2006 and became an Airborne Sensor Operator(ASO)
          conducting
          direct
          support missions in support of Special Operations Command. In 2010 I was honorably discharged and began
          working ASO contracts with SAIC special projects division (now part of Leidos).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Software Development:</b> I've always wanted to learn software development. I would write small games while
          in the
          Navy in C++ simply to try and understand how programming works. I decided to take a 6 month break from
          deploying with Leidos to Afghanistan and focus solely on web development. I attended <a
            href="www.nashvillesoftwareschool.com">Nashville Software School</a> during my 6 month break and found a
          position with ForceX.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Now:</b> I've departed ForceX to contract in software development and hone my web development skills, where
          my passion really lies.
